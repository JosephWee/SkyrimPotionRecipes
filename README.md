# SkyrimPotionRecipes
##Objectives
This project is created to learn and practice writing an ASP.NET Core Web API.
To facilitate this, we will be porting the https://github.com/JosephWee/SkyrimPotions Python program over to ASP.NET Core Web API.
Once this has been achieved, we will be writing a ASP.NET Core Web Application as the Front-end application.
